# meal-planner

## Reason for this hobby project:

Creating a meal planning app as a side project to test out skills learned during Flatiron School bootcamp.
Skills that I intend to practice while developing this full stack application include Javascript, React, Ruby, and Sinatra. Eventually I may refactor in Rails after completing that phase of bootcamp.

I would also like to practice using different CSS kits, such as Bulma https://bulma.io/documentation/columns/sizes/.

## Problem framing:

- Bootcamp is hectic and I struggle to plan the weekly grocery shop.
- Reduce overhead that comes with meal planning and meal prep at the beginning of the week.
- I would like to be able to plan my meals and create a shopping list in one place.

## Initial wireframes
